# CloudFront CDK Deployment

Similar to this [repo](https://github.com/terrificdm/cloudfrontCDK), just decoupled the single Application(Infra)+CloudFront stack into two seperated stacks: Application(Infra) stack and CloudFront stack.  
Use SSM Parameter Store to store and import S3 bucketName and EC2PublicDomainName which are generated by InfraCdkStack for CloudfrontCdkStack.
